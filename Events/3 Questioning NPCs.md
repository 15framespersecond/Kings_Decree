Identity on the baby and the hankerchief

This child is casting wild magic. It is in fact cursed with wild magic enchantment. Plus another source of magic that can not be identified. Every few minutes 1d100 rolled to get a wild magic effect. Mostly from wild magic table. What you can identify about the child is anchant 100-1000s of years. And the origin: under effect of a wish spell. The child did not cast wish on itself, but could now. Also the baby is under effects of transmutation itself. It is Rust.
