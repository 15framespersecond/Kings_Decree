Panic in the streets of [[Citadel Adbar]], panic after the kings decree, invading force looming but no strikes, only seen fires and commotion at the citadel.

Massive tower above the mountains, big holes in it with fire smoldering from it.

We are gathers in the guild hall. Hear crying on pain out side 'They coming ahhh-'
Massive streak of fire raining on the village, golden wing flying by.

Guild relics on the walls, silver staff

Ceiling on fire and collapsing, step outside and see the building cave in.

NOW just outside the building. Two pathes, orc or warlock. We chose warlock she seem well defended. 

Drake

Cobalts stabbing away at a guy, a dead guy.

Very  [['Powerful Wizard']] we do not recognize.. He is trying to help, but how and why we do not know.
