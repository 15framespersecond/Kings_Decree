we approach the east wall. Huge

Looks like a stone village and it is very cold. A small civilization is built on top of this wall. Close by is one of towers with the green energy with a very familiar magic aura with same energy as Rust. 

I have itchy arms. ... CON save and failed got a wild shape. [[Jim Hammond]] has been cursed, will be a dog,mastiff, until they die. 


Swarm of rats attack. 
Can feel human souls in the spectating creatures. around, elk/deer is notable

Rats are empty souls. Rats burned and knocked prone.

Giant Lizard and Spider, and Lion are dropping and becoming statue-esck.

Perception check by [[Angelina]]: 'find me,save me' from the [[Unicorn]]

bright divines lights from east wall and mountain scrape., all animals bow heads and back up, rats still chaotic and aggressive. 

[[Francis Arther]] Sneak attack with lots of arrow shots to push back the rats

One of the animals, the lion approach and [[Angelina]] speaks with animals. 

Lion:
'You should not be here! we Warned you! WHYWHY?'

[[Angelina]]:
What warning? We were told to come here.

Lion:
I apologize but you are here now. 

[[Jim Hammond]]:
*Growls at [[Jay]] and [[Chugs McJugs]], backs them into the corner*

[[Angelina]]:
You know about the unicorn?

Lion:
that would be our queen [[Magenta]]. We have not heard her song for so long.. Just echos
You have brought yourself upon grave... i supposed danger....(seems frustrated that [[Angelina]] can change creatures) So has queen [[Magenta]] chosen you or are you just among a path

Ang:
Who were you before?

Lion:
I was mayor before, but then people disappeared and creatures started appearing. Then I woke up liking my paws. It has been about two months now, I was trying to warn someone.. someone.. *scans around party* ahh [[Chugs McJugs]] backed into another corner! You always were a coward, no surprise. Tell me did you at least bring, ah yes with out the beard I wouldn't have recgonized it! Pardon me you have something of mine *strolls over to pick up aby rust* 

Ang:
You give birth to this baby what do you mean it is yours?

Lion:
I'm sure this creature, this .. thing might be too harsh, might not be harsh enough for what he is but I intend to find out since I am certain he can help us. You didn't meet were we agree

*Lion Leaves Attmepts to leave*...

Lion:
Taking baby to the labratory. 

Ask about the king of kings...
Lion:
How is he... still.. one of the god kings is he?

Bad haha

Lion:
Did he fall in combat?
... they were the first to turn some of them, loosing their minds so quickly, others holding onto it longer, enventually giving into their animal insticts. Fear that I will fall. Wonder who will remain in this kingdom. 

Sure her made it, hes a strong fellow heheh.

The party goes down a stair case that turns into a steep hill. Faint hum in distance... Silloete of another ship simmilar to ours about a mile into the mountain in a deep cravass behind us where we came from. The towers green and yellow glow still fight each other back and forth, every step taken it gets darker and darker until it is pitch black.
