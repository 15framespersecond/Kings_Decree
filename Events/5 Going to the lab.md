Pitch Black, party lights up torches and [[Angelina]] hears a faint humming sound. She mentions it to the lion. Lion says 'maybe you are chosen.. are just lucky' and seems to hum along.

After lighting up torches we are in a cave. A black abyss behind us. 

A unnatural darkness following us, natural darkness in front. Unnatural is collecting behind while we dispusing in front of. Powerful magic but nothing bad. Torches more effective in front over time and less in the rear. Get the sense of a powerful stagnic magic, that is faint and feels like the sunset crystal. 

I cast detect magic, see mushrooms like rocks and the room is illuminated, darkness no longer follows. 

[[Hercules Rockefeller]] rolls a 1 and touches a mushroom thinking it is a Sunset Crystal, getting damaged and beginning combat with a  Specter that arrise from the popped mushroom.  

---Combat Starts---

'For the King' --  Specter is from eons ago and warns us to leave the area
within 10 feet to hit from now on

Party hears a rumble during the combat. [[Hercules Rockefeller]] hears the following:
'You are not supposed to be here, we have not seen your kind here, our king does not appropriate  your invasion. I Reginald swear you will rue the day that you crossed me.' 

Specters dying words:
'I... I... I am eternal!'
 
---Combat ends---

Process is a lengthy one. with what is going on with the mushrooms. 

Katanta like sword found on the remains of the Specter that has a slight glow on the blade. +1 ghost blade does magic attacked and holds spirit of a ghost. Soul is connected to the unicorn somehow?  No way to determine. [[Angelina]] takes the sword and gives a religious check hearing humming. Upon taking up there is a brush of power, almost of a voice is amplified through this blade. 

Mushrooms-
are husk creatures, are violet fungus, However are all flasks for spirit energy and connected to a greater power. Connection that goes deeper into the mountain where Sunset Crystals.

soul husks
Relgion Check with mushrooms-
Feeling a powerful energy source that goes deep into the mountain. Millions of crying souls, [[Hercules Rockefeller]] takes psyhic damage

Ghost sword is calling and guiding us into the mountain.
