icey peaks 
or lush jungles

[[Mercerus]], ice peaks, civ lost to history, lots of ruins in the hills, cold brutal terrian, great richs within the hills and ruins, powerful artifacts, extremely isolated, WE ARE STARTING HERE

[[Vash'erev]], wild jungles, no history of any civ, completely preservered having rarest creatures and magic, rumors are that it is a magical place, untamed, as magic as it is dangerous.

Forest Coloney, Ruins, supposidely tamed, last centry sent there to colonize here but contact was lost after going pretty good. Lost 25 years ago. 

[[Ship Wreck Cove]], nothing

[[Slate Shelves]], volcanic mountains, very powerful and untamed, another plane of existence 'plane of fire' pokes through to the material plane. Many genies in this land, powerful kingdoms in this land. 'Kingdoms of fire plane'
